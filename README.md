# simple-dash-recommender-sys

Create custom recommendations from texts (e.g. any .txt file) based on text input field rendered as HTML in Dash. 

The recommendations result from calculations of the [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the text vectors created by the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency ([TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf)).
